In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations:

push, which adds an element to the collection, and
pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.
The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO (last in, first out). Additionally, a peek operation may give access to the top without modifying the stack.
