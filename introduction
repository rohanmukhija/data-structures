In computer science, a data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently
Data structures can implement one or more particular abstract data types (ADT), which specify the operations that can be performed on a data structure and the computational complexity of those operations. In comparison, a data structure is a concrete implementation of the space provided by an ADT
